Hello there,

This is my Advanced Java Programming 2023 Course Project. It uses Spring Boot with Java and Maven, the persistence layer is provided by PostgreSQL. Some logical changes were made since the specification. Everything is set up and configured the exact same way as during the course, except the followings:

* PostgreSQL was installed natively instead of Docker.
* OpenJDK 21 was used instead of Azul Zulu.

In accordance with the above, the application should be able to be started the usual ways.

For documentation, please refer to the following files:
